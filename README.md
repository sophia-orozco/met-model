# met-model

Scripts to reproduce simulations, figures from 'Mesenchymal to Epithelial Transition (MET) in Cancer Progression: Insights from logical modeling'. 

**Supplemenraty notebook 1** Steady state analysis

**Supplemenraty notebook 2** Model simualations under different initial conditions, analysis of autocrine loops that sustain mesenchymal states and mutation analysis. 

**emp_plots.R** Code for some of the final plots in the manuscript (the rest of the plots were directly generated from the notebooks)

To run the jupyter notebooks, one can install the conda environment provided: 

conda env create -f environment_maboss.yml
